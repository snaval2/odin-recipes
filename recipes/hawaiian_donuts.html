    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 count) package Hawaiian sweet rolls</li>
        <li>1 cup apple cider</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. </li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine the apple cider, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil over
            medium-high heat, then reduce heat and simmer until the mixture is reduced to about 1/4 cup, about 15-20
            minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Slice the Hawaiian rolls in half horizontally, being careful not to cut all the way through. Spoon the apple
            cider mixture evenly over the bottom halves of the rolls. Place the top halves back on.</li>
        <li>Place the stuffed rolls on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the rolls are
            heated through and slightly golden on top.</li>
        <li>While the rolls are baking, prepare the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and
            vanilla extract until smooth. Adjust the consistency by adding more milk if needed.</li>
        <li>Remove the rolls from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Drizzle the glaze over the warm rolls.
            Serve immediately and enjoy!
